SSA Student is an app that several other students and I wrote in 2017 to replace
SSA Mobile, which was written by an alumni from several years prior but no
longer worked with the upcoming iOS 11 release. It's an essential tool used
daily by over 500 students, faculty, and parents to manage several
school-specific functions.

While I collaborated with the Android team, I primarily developed the iOS app.
The repositories I worked in include:

* [git.nickzana.dev/SSA-Student-v5](https://git.nickzana.dev/nick/SSA-Student-v5)
* [git.nickzana.dev/SSA-Student-v4](https://git.nickzana.dev/nick/SSA-Student-v4)
* [git.nickzana.dev/SSA-Student-v3](https://git.nickzana.dev/nick/SSA-Student-v3)

There are multiple distinct versions of the app, some of which were experiments
and never published to the App Store. Notably,

It can be found on the [Google Play
Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fuad.yousseftech.studentapp)
and the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ssa-student-app/id1286346340).
